Following Neumark's theorem described in section \ref{section:neumark}, we can now implement any POVM measure of $N$ elements in a quantum circuit by applying the $N\times N$ unitary matrix $U$ resulting from Neumark's to an initial state made of the original qubit state we want to measure, together with a set of $N-1$ ancillary qubits, a.k.a. \textit{ancillas}, as follows

      && \lstick{\myvdots} & & \myvdots &\\

\end{quantikz}

As we can see in the diagram, we will obtain the different probabilities for each of the $N$ possible outcomes of the POVM, by adding a $N$ bit classical register to the circuit, which will then perform classical measures on the circuit's computational basis.

As we will show in section \ref{section:results}, these circuits will be implemented with Qiskit \cite{Qiskit}, IBM's open-source Quantum Computing SDK, and will be run using IBM's quantum processors to obtain the experimental probability distributions to be compared with the results from the classical simulations.

In order to translate the POVM's unitary matrices into universal quantum gates available in the underlying IBM's quantum processors, we could either follow Nielsen and Chuang's textbook \cite{nielsen2000}, and decompose the unitary into a sequence of two-level unitary gates, or rely on the Qiskit's transpiler, which translates any generic circuit into an optimized circuit using a backend's native gate set, allowing users to program for any quantum processor or processor architecture with minimal inputs. For the sake of simplicity we will follow on using Qiskit's transpiler.
