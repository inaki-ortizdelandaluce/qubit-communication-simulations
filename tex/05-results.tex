All the methods described in the previous section have been implemented from scratch as a software package, and have been made publicly available as an open-source project on a source code repository \cite{software2023}. The main building blocks of the code have also been included in this document for self completeness (see Appendix \ref{section:source}). All outcomes presented in this section have been acquired and are reproducible by employing the aforementioned software.

\textit{To be included:}

\textit{Random states verification}

\textit{Convergence plots, classical vs. quantum vs. theoretical probabilities}

\textit{Kullback-Leibler divergence plots}

\textit{Quantum Simulator vs. NISQ Computer benchmarking}

\textit{Bell scenario joint probabilities convergence}

\textit{CHSH inequality}
