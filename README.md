# Objective
Prove by classical and quantum computer based experiments that a qubit transmission can be simulated classically with a total cost of 2 qubits for any general measurement, either in a prepare-and-measure or a Bell scenario.

# Roadmap

## Phase A - Simulate Prepare-and-Measure PVMs classically 
Deadline: 07/02 (after Quantum Computing sessions are completed)

### A.1 - Generation of random states and projection-valued measurements

### A.2 - Classical simulation using Python

### A.3 - Generation of multiple-qubit states towards Bell scenarios preparation (see Phase D)
---
## Phase B - Simulate Prepare-and-Measure PVMs with a quantum computer
Deadline: 23/02 (before next tutored session)

### B.1 - Simulation using Qiskit Quantum Simulator

### B.2 - Simulation using IBM Quantum Computer. Error correction 
---
## Phase C - Simulate Prepare-and-Measure with POVMs

### C.1 - Generation of POVM measurements

### C.2 - Perform classical and quantum computer simulations (as per Phases A and B)
---
## Phase D - Simulate using Bell scenarios
---
## Phase E - Extend analysis to qutrits
