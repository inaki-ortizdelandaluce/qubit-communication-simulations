# qubit-transmission-simulations
Classical and quantum simulations of qubit transmission. Final Project for Postgraduate Degree in Quantum Engineering by Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

# Roadmap

## A - Simulate prepare-and-measure PVMs classically

### A.1 - Generation of random states and projector measurements

### A.2 - Classical simulation (Python)

### A.3 - Generation of multiple-qubit states towards Bell scenarios preparation

## B - Simulate prepare-and-measure PVMs classically with a quantum computer

### B.1 - Simulation using Qiskit Quantum Simulator

### B.2 - Simulation using IBM-Q Quantum Computer. Error correction 


## C - Simulate Prepare-and-Measure with POVMs

### C.1 - Generation of POVM measurements

### C.2 - Perform Classical and quantum computer simulation (as per Phase B)

## D - Simulate using Bell scenarios


# Open Questions

 - Using pure states or mixed states
 - Random states with Qiskit or uniform distribution over the Bloch sphere
